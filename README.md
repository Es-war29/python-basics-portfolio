## 4. SIP Calculator
**Description:** A simple Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) calculator built with Python to estimate the future value of your investments and returns based on monthly contributions, interest rates, and investment duration.
**Features:** 
Input Validation: Ensures all inputs (amount, interest rate, years) meet minimum requirements.
Accurate Calculations: Uses the compound interest formula to compute future value and returns.
User-Friendly Output: Displays total investment, future value, and estimated returns in a readable format.
**Formula Used:**
FV = A * (((pow((1+p),m))-1/p)*(1+p)

where 
FV: Future Value of the investment
A: Monthly investment amount
p: Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12 and expressed as a decimal)
m: Total number of installments (yearly investments multiplied by 12)


Estimated Returns:
	Estimated Returns = FV - (A*m)

**Tech Stack:** Python
**Skills Demostrated:** User Input,Loops,Conditionals.
**Code Link:** [SIP Calculator](sip_calculator/README.md)
