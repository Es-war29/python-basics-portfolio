## 1. Calculator App
**Description:** A command-line calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
**Skills Demonstrated:** User input, Conditionals.
**Tech Stack:** Python.
**Code Link:** [Calculator App](calculator/README.md)

---

## 2. Guess the Number Game
**Description:** A simple number-guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number.
**Skills Demonstrated:** Random number generation, loops, and conditionals.
**Tech Stack:** Python.
**Code Link:** [Guess the Number Game](guess_the_number/README.md)

## 3. Area Calculator
**Description:** A simple area calculator program where users give the required parameters.
**Skills Demonstrated:** Functions, user input, loops, and conditionals.
**Tech Stack:** Python.
**Code Link:** [Area Calculator](area_calculator/README.md)

## 4. SIP Calculator
**Description:** A simple Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) calculator built with Python to estimate the future value of your investments and returns based on monthly contributions, interest rates, and investment duration.
**Features:** 
Input Validation: Ensures all inputs (amount, interest rate, years) meet minimum requirements.
Accurate Calculations: Uses the compound interest formula to compute future value and returns.
User-Friendly Output: Displays total investment, future value, and estimated returns in a readable format.
**Formula Used:**
FV = A * (((pow((1+p),m))-1/p)*(1+p)

where 
FV: Future Value of the investment
A: Monthly investment amount
p: Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12 and expressed as a decimal)
m: Total number of installments (yearly investments multiplied by 12)


Estimated Returns:
	Estimated Returns = FV - (A*m)

**Tech Stack:** Python
**Skills Demostrated:** User Input,Loops,Conditionals.
**Code Link:** [SIP Calculator](sip_calculator/README.md)

## 5. To-Do App
**Description:**The To-Do List App is a command-line application written in Python that helps users manage their tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and save the tasks persistently to a file for later use. The app ensures that tasks are stored in a JSON file and reloads them upon restarting the program.

**Features:**

* Add New Tasks

* View Tasks

* Mark Tasks as Completed

* Persistent Storage

* Error Handling

**Skills Demonstarted:** Functions,Loops,Conditionals,User Inputs, Json file handling.
**Code Link:** [To-Do APP](todo_app/README.md)

## 6. Digital CLock

**Description:** This program is a simple digital clock application built using Python and PyQt5. The clock displays the current time in an easy-to-read digital format.

**Features:**
* Real-Time Clock: Displays the current time in the format hh:mm:ss AP (e.g., 12:45:30 PM).
* Text is styled with a green color and a large font size.
* Background is set to black for better readability.
* Automatic Updates: The clock updates every second using a timer.


**Requirements:**
* Python 3.x
* PyQt5 - install it.
**Skills Demonstrated:** GUI Development with PyQt5,event-driven,Object-oriented design,real-time updates with timers and UI customization.
**Code Link:** [Digital Clock](digital_clock/README.md)

## 7. Alarm 

**Description:**The Python Alarm Clock is a simple script that allows you to set an alarm for a specific time of the day. When the alarm time is reached, it plays a sound to wake you up or notify you.

**Features:**
* Set Alarm: Input the desired alarm time in HH:MM:SS format.
* Audio Notification: Plays a sound (sound.mp3) when the alarm goes off.
* Real-Time Clock Display: Continuously shows the current time in the console.

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.x
* pygame - install it.
* Sound File - download a valid mp3 file of your choice or use "sound.mp3.
**SKills Demonstrated:** Time handling, Looping, user interaction,condtion handling, modular programming,utilizing python libaries "datetime","time","pygame".
**Code LInk:** [Alarm](alarm/README.md)
