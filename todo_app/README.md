# To-Do App
The To-Do List App is a command-line application written in Python that helps users manage their tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and save the tasks persistently to a file for later use. The app ensures that tasks are stored in a JSON file and reloads them upon restarting the program.

## Features
- New Tasks
Users can add multiple tasks one by one.

Tasks are stored with a status of "Not Done" by default.
- View Tasks
Displays all tasks in a numbered list.

Shows the status of each task ("Not Done" or "Done").
- Completed Tasks
Users can mark specific tasks as completed by entering the task number.

Supports marking multiple tasks until the user exits the marking process.
- Save Tasks to a file
Tasks are saved to a tasks.json file.

Tasks are reloaded automatically when the program is restarted.

## How to Run
